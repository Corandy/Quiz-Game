# React Quiz Game

Welcome to the small app that I made in a few days.
I tried to test my skills in React & NodeJS by making this small application.

To use the application you can run the 'node live' command with npm and browsing to port 3000.

To test the application you can run the 'test' command with npm.
It will test the ButtonBar component on many levels and mock the textTransformation component through the results component.

Thank you
